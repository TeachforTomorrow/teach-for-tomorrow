   <meta name="description" content="We are a student-run non-profit organization that aims to reduce the disparity in education by volunteer tutoring K-8 underprivileged students. We provide individualized tutoring and homework help at absolutely no cost: each tutor works with just one student at a time, ensuring they receive enough support to be able to ask questions at any time, as well as become confident in their abilities. Whether it be online or in person, our tutors are committed to bringing the best possible experience to students. Though our primary purpose is to help students with their classwork, personal connections are just as important as academic success. Our goal is to not only help students learn the material, but help them stay engaged and interested. ">
